# Prediction Of Smartphone Addiction
 
Project Overview :
This project applies machine learning to predict smartphone addiction levels based on user behavior, phone usage patterns, and psychological factors. The model analyzes key indicators such as screen time, app usage, and stress levels to identify individuals at risk of smartphone addiction.
FEATURES :
✅ Predicts smartphone addiction levels using machine learning algorithms
✅ Analyzes user phone usage habits and psychological factors
✅ Supports multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
✅ Provides an easy-to-use input form for data collection
✅ Generates insights to help users manage smartphone usage
